## How to Self Host
1. Download the Bash script (main.sh) and make it executable.
2. Run the Bash script to run the Flask program.
3. After the program runs, you should be able to visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to get the REST API locally.
4. Please use a WSGI server for deployment (I recommend [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)), but you can use a local server for developing.
